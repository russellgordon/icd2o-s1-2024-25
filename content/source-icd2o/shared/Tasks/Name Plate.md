# Name Plate
## Objective

Draw the letters of your name in stick letters, using a hand-drawn plan to help get you started.
## What you'll need to begin

- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Name Plate*
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook

## Success criteria

- [ ] a plan is made to consider at least some of the necessary turtle movements to draw your name (see exemplar below)
- [ ] your name is drawn in stick, not bubble, letters, with consistent spacing
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]

## Exemplar

Here is an example of a plan for drawing letters with consistent spacing:

Note how after a while, shorthand is used to describe turtle movements. This is a good strategy for making a useful plan without taking a lot of time.

> [!TIP]
> Before moving on to draw the next letter in your name, ensure that the turtle finishes drawing a letter in the same **position** and **heading** that it started in. You will see a little later on why this is a useful approach.

## Reflection prompts

1. How long did it take you to draw out a plan?
2. How often did you refer to your plan while coding?
3. How might a plan be useful for debugging a logical error?

Make a post on [Notion](https://notion.so) to:
- [ ] share a screenshot of your work on this task
- [ ] briefly respond to the prompts above

## Extension

If you finish drawing your name using stick letters, try drawing your name using block or bubble letters, like this, in a new playground:
