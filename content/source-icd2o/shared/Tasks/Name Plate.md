## Objective

Draw the letters of your name in stick letters, using a hand-drawn plan to help get you started.

## What you'll need to begin

- [ ] The [[Installing Playgrounds|Playgrounds app]] installed on your computer
- [ ] Another copy of the [[Subscribe to Turtle Sketches|Sketches Template added to your list of playgrounds]], renamed to be titled *Name Plate*
- [ ] Graph paper

## Success criteria

- [ ] a plan is made to consider at least some of the necessary turtle movements to draw your name (see exemplar below)
- [ ] your name is drawn in stick, not bubble, letters, with consistent spacing
- [ ] code includes [[Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]

## Exemplar

Here is an example of a plan for drawing letters with consistent spacing:

Note how after a while, shorthand is used to describe turtle movements. This is a good strategy for making a useful plan without taking a lot of time.

> [!TIP]
> Before moving on to draw the next letter in your name, ensure that the turtle finishes drawing a letter in the same **position** and **heading** that it started in. You will see a little later on why this is a useful approach.

## Extension

If you finish drawing your name using stick letters, try drawing your name using block or bubble letters, like this, in a new playground:

## Reflection prompts

1. How long did it take you to draw out a plan?
2. How often did you refer to your plan while coding?
3. How might a plan be useful for debugging a logical error?

On the back of your plan made on paper, please respond in point form or sentence form to the prompts given above. Hold on to these responses until our next class – you will need them then.
