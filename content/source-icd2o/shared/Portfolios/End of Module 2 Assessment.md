## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio self-assessment – at the midpoint of the course and end of module two – is to determine whether you are currently approaching, meeting, or exceeding course expectations – and to set goals to improve further in the next module of this course.

## Due date and approach

This self-assessment of your portfolio should be completed prior to the end of this period. It is intended to take, at the very most, 30 minutes to complete. Be thoughtful but do not *over*-think this.

## Iterative improvement

Recall the steps of the design process, as first described in our course outline:

While a portfolio itself is not a product, a portfolio *can* be iteratively improved.

## Act on current feedback

So, how can you improve your portfolio?

## Assess your current achievement level

This time, ask yourself four questions related to the four evaluation categories:

1. *Knowledge:* Have I fully completed the provided tutorials in each class to build my knowledge base?
2. *Thinking*: Have I shared detailed plans for my work and at least once described a problem that I debugged and how I solved that problem?
3. *Application*: Did I complete every suggested exercise, and importantly, was I able show an understanding of all key concepts when creating original products?
4. *Communication*: When making posts in my portfolio, did I explain my thinking regularly and in detail using subject-specific vocabulary?

If you can answer – *"Yes, always!"* – to all four questions above, then you are certainly exceeding expectations. Estimate a grade for yourself that is something higher than 85%.

If you cannot answer in the affirmative for all questions above, you may still be meeting expectations. Estimate a grade for yourself in the range of 70% to 85%.

If you know there are significant gaps in your demonstrated understanding, you are approaching expectations. Estimate a grade for yourself that is something lower than 70%.

> Finally, complete these two tasks:
> 
> 1. Make an entry in your [portfolio on Notion](https://notion.so) titled *End of Module 2 Self-Assessment* and state your estimated grade.
>    
>    To support your case for that grade you may respond briefly to each of the four prompts given above.
>    
>    Feel free to copy-and-paste the four provided prompts into your post on Notion.
