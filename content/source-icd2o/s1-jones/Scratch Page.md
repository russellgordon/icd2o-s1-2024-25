## Playground with goToHome function

https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/icd2o/GoingHomeAgainComplete.playgroundbook.zip

```swift
// Make the turtle return to the origin
func goHome() {
    
    // Pick up the pen so a trail is not left behind
    turtle.penUp()
    
    // Get the turtle's current position
    let x = turtle.currentPosition().x
    let y = turtle.currentPosition().y

    // Go home, using the opposite value of turtle's position
    turtle.diagonal(dx: x * -1, dy: y * -1)
    
    // Put down the pen again
    turtle.penDown()
}

```
